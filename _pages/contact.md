Email’s the best way to get in touch: 

**{{ site.email }}**

<div class="tag-list copy-buttons">

<button class="btn btn-default" onclick="copyEmailtoClipboard('{{site.email}}')">Copy email address</button>

<a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">Send email</a>
</div>

Please reach out, I always enjoy a chance to talk shop with other CS/ML professionals, or like-minded folks. 

I’m not that active on social media, but you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alirezasamar), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alirezasamar) and [GitHub](https://github.com/alirezasamar). 

Even better than social, is [RSS](/feed.xml).
