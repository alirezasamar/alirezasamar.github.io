It’s been an eventful few months, and I’m not sure all the changes have fully sunk in yet. 

After almost three years, I’m leaving Wix in a couple of weeks. It’d be hard to overstate how much I learned as a UX writer there and what an opportunity it was to work with so many amazing people. But things aren’t what they once were, and a change has been overdue. 

My next professional adventure is becoming the solo UX writer at [Hubs](https://www.hubs.com). This means leaving Ukraine, which I’ve called home for the majority of my adult life. Amsterdam here I come!

Behind the scenes, I’ve finished up my [UX certification from NN/g](/blog/nng-ux-certification). It was a great experience, I learned a ton and highly recommend it for mid-career UX professionals. 

The heat of summer is gone, I’m contemplating how to pack my life into a couple of suitcases and looking forward to a much needed six weeks off between jobs.

Next project? Learning Dutch. 🚲🌷⛵️
